This is a set of scripts who run in the client-side `ovm` and leverage the insi client to script all external actions to the server
through "objects" in the runtime.

- `scripts/demos`   : Light weight example scripts for some basic functionality
- `scripts/stress`  : Some stress tests for a system
- `scripts/tests`   : Full suite of integration tests that ensure the `ovm` instance is at 100% integration with the insi client and fully exercises a cluster's functionality
- `scripts/utils`   : Helper CLI-like tools to use to perform common actions when working with an insi instance
